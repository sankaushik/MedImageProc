# MedImageProc
Starter kit for working with medical image data 

## Tasks covered: 
Code snippets will be updated soon for the following...
1. DICOM series read and write NRRD
2. DICOM series or NRRD image read and return ITK object
3. Read an ITK image and print its information
4. Read an ITK image and convert it into a numpy array
5. Image normalization scheme

## Useful medical image tools 
1. [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php)
2. [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/)
3. [MITK](https://www.mitk.org/wiki/The_Medical_Imaging_Interaction_Toolkit_(MITK))
4. [RadiAnt](https://www.radiantviewer.com/)

If anyone interested in getting started with medical image data processing and would like to collaborate on this project to build simple examples, I am happy to create simple tasks and guide with the process.
